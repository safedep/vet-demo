`vet version`{{exec}}

## ðŸŽ¯ Setup the environment

* Lets clone a sample repository to perform scanning using `vet`

`git clone https://github.com/safedep/demo-client-python demo-app`{{exec}}

* Change directory to the cloned repository
* All commands will be executed from this directory onwards

`cd ./demo-app`{{exec}}

> **Note**
> This repository is a simple Python application that uses intentionally old and vulnerable dependencies. 
> This will help us test the scanning capabilities of `vet`.
